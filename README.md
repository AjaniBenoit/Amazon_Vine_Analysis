# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Project Overview

Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publisher to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small free to amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. 

In this project PySpark was used to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data and connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. 

### Results 

Google Colab was used to successful complete the ETL process. However the code connecting to the AWS RD instance did not function correctly and was unable to load the data into pgAdmin.
